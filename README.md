# Project Three

1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

Answer: The project aimed to prompt the user with a menu containing four options and execute the chosen option utilizing the input file "CS210_Project_Three_Input_File". Those four options were:
  
  Option one:
    Prompts the user to input an item's name they wish to look for. Then, returns the number of times that item was purchased.
    
  Option Two:
    Prints a list containing all the items and the number of times that item was purchased as a numerical value.
    
  Option Three:
    Prints a histogram containing all the items and the number of times that item was purchased as a unique character.
    
  Option Four:
    Ends the program.


2. What did you do particularly well?

Answer: Using vectors to produce the correct output is where my program shines because of its clever logic.

 
3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

Answer: I could enhance my code in the area that obtains the frequency of an item by utilizing maps or pointers instead of vectors. Its utilization would make my code editable and applicable to larger datasets. Also, it could make it reliable to produce the correct output for various situations.


4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

Answer: Coming up with the algorithm to obtain the number of times each item was bought was the most challenging part of the project. I overcame this hurdle by being persistent and patient. Furthermore, I have noted multiple websites as resources to enhance my coding ability in various programming languages. For this course, my go-to resource was https://cplusplus.com/.


5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?

Answer: The logic behind the various codes read and created throughout the course. Furthermore, the most valuable topics for me were pointers and polymorphism, which will be important in my future programming endeavors.


6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Answer: By separating the program into three files and adding in-line comments.
